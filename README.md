Final Project for Grand Circus Java TechHire Bootcamp (with New Redesigns and Features)

MoGo With Me was created with the average Detroit resident in mind who would like to utilize the new MoGo bike sharing program.
MoGo With Me connects bicyclists together so no one has to ride alone. Users create a profile and then add details about their up-coming 
MoGo bike ride. A list of matches appears for the user to choose from. Once the user finds someone they would like to ride with they can 
submit a request to that person. When submitting a request, a text message is sent to their match notifying them of their request. 
It is then up to their match to contact them with further details.
